# Flask Weather Web App

See the weather reports for different cities, using <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeatherMap</a> API and optionally remove queried cities from view later.

# Set Up
(Assuming in Terminal)
To launch the virtual environment with the required packages (see Pipfile) and run the web application, enter the following:
```
pipenv install
pipenv shell
python3 main.py
```

This will create a 'weather.db' file inside the 'instance' directory. To interact or access the web app, use any web browser and visit: http://127.0.0.1:5000.
